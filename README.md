# TACOS Governance

This repo will contain the early governance practices for the Trusted Attestation and Compliance for Open Source (TACOS) framework, including a CoC, contribution guidelines, and other processes based on the [Community Specification model and license](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/1.0) from the [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org).

TACOS does not currently have a steering committee, but we are actively seeking interested participants. [Email us](mailto:support@tidelift.com) to join!
